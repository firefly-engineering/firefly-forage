# Version Control: JJ (Jujutsu)

This workspace uses `jj` for version control:

```bash
jj status         # Show working copy status
jj diff           # Show changes
jj new            # Create new change
jj describe -m "" # Set commit message
jj bookmark set   # Update bookmark
```

This is an isolated jj workspace - changes don't affect other workspaces.
