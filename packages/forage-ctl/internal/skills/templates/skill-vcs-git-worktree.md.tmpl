# Version Control: Git (Worktree)

This workspace is a git worktree with its own working directory and branch.

**Branch**: `{{.GitBranch}}`

```bash
git status        # Show working tree status
git diff          # Show changes
git add -p        # Stage changes interactively
git commit -m ""  # Create commit on this branch
git push -u origin {{.GitBranch}}  # Push branch
```

This is an isolated git worktree - commits on this branch don't affect other worktrees.
When done, merge your branch or create a pull request.
